### BatchNorm2d (Batch Normalization) and Its Learnable Parameters:
- **BatchNorm2d** is a technique used in deep learning to normalize the output of a layer, helping stabilize and accelerate the training process. It normalizes activations within a batch, reducing internal covariate shift.
  
- The process involves adjusting the activations of each feature (such as each channel in a 2D convolutional layer) within the current batch, ensuring the output has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. However, **BatchNorm2d** introduces two **learnable parameters**:
  - **Gamma (γ)**: A scaling factor that enables the network to stretch or shrink the normalized output.
  - **Beta (β)**: A shifting factor that allows the network to shift the normalized output up or down.
  
- These learnable parameters (gamma and beta) provide the network with flexibility, enabling it to reverse the normalization if needed and adapt to the optimal transformations for each layer.

### ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) and No Learnable Parameters:
- **ReLU** is a non-linear activation function that outputs the input directly if it’s positive, or zero if it’s negative. In mathematical terms:  
  \[
  ReLU(x) = \max(0, x)
  \]

- **ReLU has no learnable parameters**. It’s a fixed transformation that does not require any training during the model's learning process. 

- Because ReLU is applied directly to the output of neurons, it can be used multiple times across different layers without any impact on the model's behavior. Each application of ReLU simply processes the output independently without introducing any complexity or parameter interactions.

### Why is the Output of BatchNorm2d Not Used as a Skipping Layer?
- Unlike **ReLU**, which is a fixed function and does not require any learnable parameters, **BatchNorm2d** includes learnable parameters (gamma and beta). These parameters are specific to each layer and could behave differently if reused across multiple layers. When the same normalization parameters (γ and β) are applied to different layers, they might interact and lead to unintended effects on the model's behavior.
  
- Since **ReLU** is a simple, fixed function, it can be applied repeatedly across multiple layers without causing issues. Each layer uses ReLU independently, ensuring consistent behavior without any learning or parameter interaction.
