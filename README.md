## Image Generation

This repository contains various architectures for training image generation models, along with notes on Computer Graphics.

The Computer Graphics notes can be found in the [directory](./Computer%20Graphics/).

The code for training image generation models is available in the notebooks. The implementation of the training code in the notebooks uses PyTorch. The current implementations available are:
- DCGAN
- UNet

Happy coding! ðŸ˜„ðŸ’»ðŸš€
