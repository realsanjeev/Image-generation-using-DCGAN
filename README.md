## Image Generation

This repository contains various architectures for training image generation models, along with notes on Computer Graphics.

The Computer Graphics notes can be found in the [Computer Graphics directory](./Computer%20Graphics/).

The code for training image generation models is available in the notebooks. The implementation of the training code in the notebooks uses PyTorch. The current implementations available are:

* [GAN Architecture Notebook](./notebooks/01_GAN_Architecture.ipynb)
* [U-Net Architecture Notebook](./notebooks/02_U-Net_Architecture.ipynb)
* [Diffusion Model Architecture Notebook](./notebooks/03_Diffusion_Models.ipynb)
* [Optimizing the Diffusion Model Notebook](./notebooks/04_Optimizations.ipynb)
* [Classifier-Free Diffusion Model Notebook](./notebooks/05_Classifier_Free_Diffusion.ipynb)
* [Image Generation Using CLIP Notebook](./notebooks/06_CLIP.ipynb)
* [Inference on Stable Diffusion XL Base 1.0 (from Hugging Face)](./stable_diffusion_xl_base_1_0_%28text_to_image%29.ipynb)


Happy coding! 😄💻🚀
