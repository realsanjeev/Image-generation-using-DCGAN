### Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network
A deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) is a kind of generative model that combines adversarial training and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Since they were created primarily for creating realistic images, DCGANs have found extensive use in projects like image synthesis, image editing, and data augmentation.

DCGANs are made up of two basic parts: a generator network and a discriminator network. The generator is responsible for discriminating between actual images (from a training dataset) and fake images generated by the generator, while the discriminator is responsible for taking random noise as input and generating synthetic images.

### Overview of Training
The model was trained using the FashionMNIST dataset. To generate a 28x28 image, a noise vector of size 100 was used as input in the latent space. The noise vector was sampled from a normal distribution.

Weights of conv layer was initialized which mean is 0.0 and standard deviation 0.02.

The beta(β) controls the moving average. The value of β is between [0, 1), representing the decay rate of the moving average.
